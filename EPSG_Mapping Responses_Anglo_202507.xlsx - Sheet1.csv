To address these challenges, the following actions are recommended: - Security Forces: Step up operations against armed groups and protect electoral commission offices nationwide. - Judicial System: Speedily punish those behind election violence to deter future incidents. - Parties and Candidates: Tone down inflammatory rhetoric and focus on substantive issues. - Electoral Commission: Ensure the credibility of elections by minimizing technical flaws and curbing vote buying. - International Support: Sustain support, including diplomatic sanctions for those who incite violence, and provide financial and technical assistance to civil society organizations working to curb electoral violence. - Peace Accords: Encourage parties to sign accords agreeing to accept election outcomes or challenge them in court rather than through violence.",Regional level;,Nigeria,,"Advocacy and/or awareness-raising campaigns;Training, workshops, and capacity building (virtual and physical) related to electoral process;Social dialogue, community dialogue;Organizing of conferences and/or seminars at various levels (regional, national, and/or local);",,Not yet,"1.

Below are actionable recommendations, categorized by key areas. 1. Legal and Institutional Reform Recommended Actions: Strengthen enforcement of the Electoral Act and cybercrime laws to deter electoral offenses. Establish special electoral offenses tribunals to enable swift prosecution and punishment. Empower INEC with autonomy and resources to implement and enforce election guidelines without political interference. Improve the capacity of the Nigeria Police Force and judiciary to handle electoral disputes, violence, and digital crimes. 2. Countering Disinformation and Hate Speech Recommended Actions: Support the development of fact-checking platforms and social media monitoring tools during election seasons. Work with tech platforms (e.g., Meta, Twitter/X, WhatsApp) to flag, remove, or de-amplify harmful content and fake news. Launch nationwide media literacy and civic education campaigns, particularly targeting youth and women in rural areas.

Lack of Voter Education and Digital Literacy:     Many citizens, especially in rural areas, lack the skills to distinguish between credible information and politically motivated fake news, making them susceptible to manipulation.

Weak Digital and Media Literacy Many citizens lack the skills to evaluate information, making them vulnerable to manipulation critically. There is low awareness about how disinformation spreads on platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and TikTok. 2. Inadequate Fact-checking Ecosystem Limited fact-checking organizations with insufficient reach and resources. The lack of local language fact-checking initiatives hampers their broader impact. 3. Unregulated Political Communication Political actors and influencers spread disinformation and hate speech with impunity. Weak enforcement of electoral communication guidelines and sanctions. 4. Ethnic and Religious Divides Hate speech is often framed within identity politics, fueling pre-existing tensions. Electoral narratives are frequently ethnically polarized. 5. Limited Collaboration Between Stakeholders Civil society, media, tech platforms, and the electoral commission often operate in silos. Absence of joint rapid-response mechanisms during electoral crises. 6. Insufficient Monitoring Tools and Infrastructure Lack of real-time systems for detecting digital threats and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Inadequate data collection and archiving hinder understanding of trends over time. Recommended Actions A. Strengthen Media and Information Literacy Launch large-scale media literacy campaigns across schools, communities, and religious institutions to promote informed decision-making. Integrate critical thinking and digital literacy into national educational curricula to enhance student learning. B. Expand Localized Fact-checking Capacity Support the creation and scaling of community-driven fact-checking groups, especially in indigenous languages. Train youth and journalists as frontline verifiers during election cycles. C. Enforce Regulations on Political Messaging Empower the electoral commission and regulatory agencies to penalize disinformation and hate speech. Mandate transparency in political ad spending and messaging on digital platforms. D. Promote Peace Messaging and Interethnic Dialogue Engage with cultural, religious, and traditional leaders to promote inclusive narratives. Use storytelling, documentaries, and local radio to depolarize public opinion. E. Enhance Collaboration Among Stakeholders Create multi-stakeholder coalitions involving civil society, tech platforms, security agencies, and the electoral body. Develop a joint electoral crisis response framework for real-time coordination and collaboration. F. Invest in Technology for Monitoring and Early Warning Build or support platforms that can detect hate speech, misinformation, and digital threats in real-time.

We take advantage of every opportunity to enlighten them on the importance of active civic participation, particularly as they approach voting age.

Our advocacy emphasizes critical factors to consider when exercising their voting rights, such as understanding candidate manifestos, evaluating leadership qualities, and being informed about electoral reforms and processes. We encourage them to stay engaged with electoral developments and governance issues in the country.

Importantly, we strongly advise against selling or trading their votes for money or material gains. Such actions not only undermine the democratic process but also compromise their ability to hold elected leaders accountable. Moreover, vote trading is a violation of the electoral laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Through this initiative, we aim to raise a generation of responsible, informed citizens committed to promoting good governance and democratic values.

Weak Enforcement of Electoral Laws: Despite existing legal frameworks, political actors often incite violence or spread disinformation with little consequence, reinforcing a culture of impunity. 	2.	Religious and Regional Polarization: Political campaigns frequently exploit ethnic and religious identities, fueling hate speech and tensions that escalate during elections. 	3.	Weaponization of Youth and Poverty: Young people, due to unemployment and political marginalization, are often recruited by politicians as agents of electoral disruption. 	4.	Low Digital and Civic Literacy: Many citizens struggle to critically evaluate information, making them susceptible to fake news, propaganda, and inciting messages on social media. 	5.	Inadequate Early Warning and Response Systems: While violence is often predictable, Nigeria lacks robust community-based mechanisms to prevent escalation before, during, and after elections.  Recommended Actions: 	1.	Enforce Accountability for Electoral Offenses: Strengthen the independence and capacity of institutions like INEC, security agencies, and the judiciary to investigate and prosecute electoral crimes swiftly. 	2.	Invest in Civic and Peace Education: Scale up national programs focused on civic awareness, digital literacy, and peaceful participation, especially targeting youth and first-time voters. 	3.	Promote Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue: Engage political parties, civil society, media, and traditional institutions in pre-election peace accords and community-based dialogues to reduce tensions. 	4.	Regulate and Monitor Online Spaces: Collaborate with tech companies and fact-checking organizations to track and address disinformation and hate speech, while safeguarding freedom of expression. 	5.

Strengthening Electoral Processes
Our organization recognizes the importance of strengthening electoral processes to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. We believe that:

- Electoral Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of electoral processes is crucial for building trust in democratic institutions.

- Promoting Media Literacy: Educating citizens on how to critically evaluate information and identify disinformation.
-Encouraging Inter-Party Dialogue: Fostering dialogue among political parties to promote peaceful elections and reduce tensions.

Ethno-Religious Divisions: Political campaigns often exploit identity lines, inflaming tensions and deepening distrust. Impunity and Weak Justice Systems: Perpetrators of electoral violence and hate speech are rarely prosecuted, encouraging repetition.  Poor Media Literacy and Misinformation: Social media platforms are widely used to spread fake news, especially in local languages, with limited regulation or counter-narratives.  Limited Civil Society Reach and Coordination: Many grassroots organizations lack the resources and coordination needed for preventive action during election periods. Recommendations: Strengthen civic and voter education, especially at the grassroots. Engage youth through peace education, employment programs, and electoral integrity campaigns.
